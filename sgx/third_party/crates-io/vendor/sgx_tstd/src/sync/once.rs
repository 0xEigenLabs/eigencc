//! A "once initialization" primitive
//!
//! This primitive is meant to be used to run one-time initialization. An
//! example use case would be for initializing an FFI library.

// A "once" is a relatively simple primitive, and it's also typically provided
// by the OS as well (see `pthread_once` or `InitOnceExecuteOnce`). The OS
// primitives, however, tend to have surprising restrictions, such as the Unix
// one doesn't allow an argument to be passed to the function.
//
// As a result, we end up implementing it ourselves in the standard library.
// This also gives us the opportunity to optimize the implementation a bit which
// should help the fast path on call sites. Consequently, let's explain how this
// primitive works now!
//
// So to recap, the guarantees of a Once are that it will call the
// initialization closure at most once, and it will never return until the one
// that's running has finished running. This means that we need some form of
// blocking here while the custom callback is running at the very least.
// Additionally, we add on the restriction of **poisoning**. Whenever an
// initialization closure panics, the Once enters a "poisoned" state which means
// that all future calls will immediately panic as well.
//
// So to implement this, one might first reach for a `Mutex`, but those cannot
// be put into a `static`. It also gets a lot harder with poisoning to figure
// out when the mutex needs to be deallocated because it's not after the closure
// finishes, but after the first successful closure finishes.
//
// All in all, this is instead implemented with atomics and lock-free
// operations! Whee! Each `Once` has one word of atomic state, and this state is
// CAS'd on to determine what to do. There are four possible state of a `Once`:
//
// * Incomplete - no initialization has run yet, and no thread is currently
//                using the Once.
// * Poisoned - some thread has previously attempted to initialize the Once, but
//              it panicked, so the Once is now poisoned. There are no other
//              threads currently accessing this Once.
// * Running - some thread is currently attempting to run initialization. It may
//             succeed, so all future threads need to wait for it to finish.
//             Note that this state is accompanied with a payload, described
//             below.
// * Complete - initialization has completed and all future calls should finish
//              immediately.
//
// With 4 states we need 2 bits to encode this, and we use the remaining bits
// in the word we have allocated as a queue of threads waiting for the thread
// responsible for entering the RUNNING state. This queue is just a linked list
// of Waiter nodes which is monotonically increasing in size. Each node is
// allocated on the stack, and whenever the running closure finishes it will
// consume the entire queue and notify all waiters they should try again.
//
// You'll find a few more details in the implementation, but that's the gist of
// it!
