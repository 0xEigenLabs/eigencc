## Abstract

This proposal aims to provide confidential operator implementation specification.

## Motivation

Depends on the [EGIP 00001](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/docs/egip/00001.md), It's possible, but not very easy to implement confidential business logic in contract. This proposal introduced a specification to declare and define confidential operators.

## Specification

The framework [EigenCC](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/tree/main/cc) provides an [easy way](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/docs/operators.md) to add new instruction in trusted execution environment(TEE). We focus on 2 important parts to leverage the confidential trusted computing environment.

- Confidential operators: what operators inside TEE can be provided and how it get done;
- Secure transportation: how the privacy information is sent or received from the Eigen Network without privacy breach;
- On-chain data protection: how we store the privacy information on chain.

### Confidential operators

What we need the most is:

- Three arithmetic operators: addition, subtraction and multiplication on 256bits integer
- Comparison operators: greater than, less than and equal
- Debug operators: encryption and decryption

As we mentioned on EGIP 00001, we use format as below to describe an input of `eigenCall`:

```
operator||num_of_args,arg1,arg2,arg3
```

Operator is the name of above operators, and 9 operators have provided:

| Operator              | Args           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Secure transportation

Referring to the security mechanism of TLS, we adopt the [RA-TLS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05863.pdf) schema for the a secure channel between end-user and EigenCC. The general workflow is like below:

![ra-tls](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/raw/main/docs/images/ra-tls.png)

The main updates is we put the Enclave Quote embedded to X509 certificate, and the challenger verifies the quote after the general certificate verification.

In our implementation, we provide a socket-based channel between EGVM(AVM) and EigenCC.

Hence, all above encrypted item are encrypted by an ECC public key with [ECIES](https://github.com/ieigen/eigen_service/tree/main/src/ecies.ts). When EigenCC launches, it will generate an ECC key pair, and the public key will be registered to [PKCS](https://github.com/ieigen/eigen_service/tree/main#pkcs).

### On-chain data protection

This is a tough issue. Since the on-chain data is openly accessed by anyone, if a vulnerable logic or weak key was used, it leads all the privacy inside the corresponding contract will be exposed to everyone. Hence, how to encrypt the on-chain data becomes crucial.

It recommends to take the secret key into custody by the owner itself, and use `re_encrypt` to encrypt the privacy information, and upgrades the key periodically.

## Rationale

It aims to provide pricy and most compatible privacy protection schema for on-chain privacy computing.

## Backwards Compatibility

## TestCases

All tests for confidential operators can be found at [demo.ts](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/confidential-contracts/tests/demo.ts).

## Implementation

Confidential ERC20 had been implemented at [TestCCCustomToken.sol](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/confidential-contracts/contracts/tokenbridge/test/TestCCCustomToken.sol). the coming confidential contract will be AMM-based DEX.
To make it easy use and save gases, we implement a link library named `EigenCallLibrary` [here](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/confidential-contracts/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/EigenCallLibrary.sol). It can be deployed on L2 and anyone can call them if deployed with the address.
`EigenCallLibrary` is implemented based on [EGIP 00001](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/docs/egip/00001.md), for now, we have implemented these public functions in [https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/confidential-contracts/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/EigenCallLibrary.sol].
These functions hidden the details of implementations of `eigenCall`, so the user do not care about how to compose a `eigenCall` input bytes, or how to decode the returning RLP encoded value. A `assert` is put into each wrapper functions to ensure `eigenCall` is called successfully. If any error occurs, the contract call will cause transaction revert with a message.
To use `EigenCallLibrary` in a contrart, just import it with the right path, and regard it as a typical link library. For example, in [TestCCCustomToken.sol](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/confidential-contracts/contracts/tokenbridge/test/TestCCCustomToken.sol), `demo_addCipherCipher` function calls `EigenCallLibrary.addCipherCipher`:

```solidity
function demo_addCipherCipher(bytes memory cipher1, bytes memory cipher2)
        public
        pure
        returns (bytes memory)
{
    bytes memory output = EigenCallLibrary.addCipherCipher(cipher1, cipher2);
    return output;
}
```

The `output` is ensured a valid cipher result of `addCipherCipher` operator. So the user can use the result without caring about the correctness of the result.
Other `demo_*` functions can be found in _TestCCCustomToken.sol_.
If we want to call the contract function in Javascript or Typescript, we should tell the link libaray address in the contract we want to use `EigenCallLibrary`.
For example, we can see the snippet in [exec.js](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/demo-eigencall/scripts/exec.js):

```js
// ...
var L2EigenCallLibrary = await (
  await ethers.getContractFactory("EigenCallLibrary")
).connect(l2Wallet);
L2EigenCallLibrary = await L2EigenCallLibrary.deploy();
await L2EigenCallLibrary.deployed();
console.log(
  "EigenCallLibrary is deployed at address:",
  L2EigenCallLibrary.address
);

var L2EigenCallLibraryUseDemo = await (
  await ethers.getContractFactory("EigenCallLibraryUseDemo", {
    libraries: {
      EigenCallLibrary: L2EigenCallLibrary.address,
    },
  })
).connect(l2Wallet);

console.log("Deploying EigenCallLibraryUseDemo contract to L2");
L2EigenCallLibraryUseDemo = await L2EigenCallLibraryUseDemo.deploy({
  gasLimit: 25000000,
});
await L2EigenCallLibraryUseDemo.deployed();
console.log(
  `EigencallDemo contract is deployed to ${L2EigenCallLibraryUseDemo.address}`
);
// ...
```

Before deploy `EigenCallLibraryUseDemo` which uses `EigenCallLibrary`, we should ensure that we have got the link address of it, after passing it to the factory function, the contract can be deployed successfully.
The Typescript example can be found in [cc.ts](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/confidential-contracts/scripts/cc.ts), it is similar with the Javascript snippet.
After the successful deployment, we can freely call these contract functions with TEE operators support!
As an detail example, we implement a confidential ERC20 in [TestCCCustomToken.sol](https://github.com/ieigen/ieigen/blob/main/l2/eigen-tutorials/packages/confidential-contracts/contracts/tokenbridge/test/TestCCCustomToken.sol). The math operators used in balance calculation are privacy operators. For example, in _TestCCCustomToken.sol_, `transfer` can be implemented as:

```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
  // ...

  bytes memory sender_cipher_hex_balance = _cipher_balances[_msgSender()];
  bytes memory sender_cipher_hex = EigenCallLibrary.subCipherPlain(
    sender_cipher_hex_balance,
    amount
  );
  _cipher_balances[_msgSender()] = EigenCallLibrary.copyBytes(sender_cipher_hex);
  bytes memory recipient_cipher_hex_balance = _cipher_balances[recipient];
  bytes memory recipient_cipher_hex = EigenCallLibrary.addCipherPlain(
    recipient_cipher_hex_balance,
    amount
  );
  _cipher_balances[recipient] = EigenCallLibrary.copyBytes(recipient_cipher_hex);
  emit TransferCipher(_msgSender(), recipient, bytes(amount.toString()));
  return true;
}
```

`add` and `sub` are replaces with privacy operators. Quite easy to use `EigenCallLibrary`.
