## Abstract

Eigen Secret Recovery Protocol aims to provide a non-custodial mechanism to help end-users and projects to store and restore the private key and other secretive data. The protocol ensures that no one expect the owner can access the plain key or data.

## Motivation

One of the great challenges with making cryptocurrency and blockchain applications usable for average users is security.     By Vitalik Buterin,  [Why we need wide adoption of social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html).

The first challenge for the beginners to adopt this blockchain is how to store their private key or secret words safely.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNsP6MIkVD0) presents some popular ways to achieve that.  Observe that there are 2 different approaches: 

* Custodial: The CEX like Coinbase and Binance help people to store their private key. It's easy-to-use but breaks the confidentiality and anonymity of user's privacy, and may not as safer as them should be, it's a common sight that we often get shaken up by the data leakage of Big internet giants like Facebook(Meta).
* Non-Custodial:  Metamask and [Formatic](https://fortmatic.com/) is the typical implementation. Metamask and some other [Ethereum wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) obey the same rationale, which is that let user themself to remember the password for key encryption and store the encrypted key.  Formatic utilizes the Cloud OAuth and Cloud KMS to help users to store the keys. But It's still centralized, since it heavily depends on the availability of AWS.  Non-custodial secret recovery mechanism will not let anyone except it's owner to access the secret. 

Eigen Secret Recovery Protocol leverages the hardware based confidentiality enhancement technology to decomposed the Login system and KMS system on the shoulder of the Formatic, with the result of high availability, decentralized and more security.

## Specification

### Terminology

**TEE**:  Trusted execution environment, TEE ensure the integrity of user's program and confidentiality of the program's execution process.  The most well-known implementation is Intel SGX,  more detailed can be found in our previous in-deep explaining [post](https://ieigen.medium.com/eigen-lab-decrypt-tee-advanced-course-8ddcad100068). 

**ECIES**:  ECIES is a public-key authenticated encryption scheme, which works similarly to the above code examples, but uses a KDF (key-derivation function) for deriving separate MAC key and symmetric encryption key from the ECDH shared secret. It has many variants.  Eigen provides ECIES [JS](https://github.com/ieigen/eigen_service/blob/main/src/crypto/ecies.ts) and [Rust](https://github.com/ieigen/eigen-crypto/blob/merge/src/ec/suite_b/ecies.rs) implementations.

Eigen TEE **Relay**:  The Relay runs in the Intel SGX Enclave, and generates an ECC key pair after launching, then registers the public key to Eigen Service PKCS.  Due to the TEE's confidentiality,  No one can access the private key. 

Eigen Dashboard:  user interface for send, exchange and portfolio management.

OAuth2:  OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices. 

Eigen Service:  cooperates with Google OAuth2,  Eigen Service maintains the user's OAuth2 token as scoped credential for accessing the corresponding resources.

### Dataflow 

#### Create a new user

#### Sign Transaction

### Recovery

## Rationale

* Security and Non-custodial 

User's key is encrypted by Eigen Relay with Cloud KMS, and No one except the owner can access the plain key.  The key was encrypted by Cloud KMS, and then saved by Eigen Service with multiple cloud storage as backend, this ensure that the key will never get lost.

* Login anywhere easily with no password

The users can use  their Web2 accounts to login, and restore their private key for signing transaction, there is no need to remember the password , and you can login in device application, or desktop applications. 

* Easy-to-recovery

Recovery is simple and easy to use.  If you can recover Web2 account, you can recover your private key. 

* Easy-to-integrate

For the developers, you can easily integrate this functionality into your Dapps with our Relay SDK.
