## Simple Summary

To provide external call from Solidity and AVM

## Abstract

By adding a new built-in function in Solidity and AVM to support different privacy computing protocol on Layer2

## Motivation

Enhance the privacy of smart contract by EigenCC or EigenFL.

## Specification

### API spec
1. Function signature

   ```solidity
   function eigenCall(bytes calldata) external pure returns (bytes memory);
   ```

2. Input

   * `rlp_bytes`: The RLP encoded of a list which contains 4 string elements just like `[operator, arg1, arg2, arg3]`. `operator`, `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3` are all strings.
     - `operator` can be "add_cipher_cipher", "add_cipher_plain", "sub_cipher_cipher", "sub_cipher_plian", "encrypt", "descrypt", "compare_cipher_cipher", and "compare_cipher_plain"
     - `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3` should be operand. According to the kind of operator, they represent different meanings, e.g., if `operator` is "add_cipher_cipher", `arg1` and `arg2` should be ciphers which are base64 encoding ECIES cipher; if `operator` is "add_cipher_plian", `arg1` should be ciphers which is base64 encoding ECIES cipher, but `arg2` should be plain number
     - The list must contain 4 elements, so if `argn` is not used, it should be set to empty string (that is "")

3. Returns

   * results: The RLP encoded of a string

### Dispute Assertion
The eigenCall is executed off the chain as a kind of secure out-soured computing. While outsouring, the computing power provider, namely prover, will generate a signature in TEE or a ZKP in Non-TEE, 
as the OneStepProof.
