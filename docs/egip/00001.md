## Simple Summary

To provide external call from Solidity and AVM

## Abstract

By adding a new built-in function in Solidity and AVM to support different privacy computing protocol on Layer2

## Motivation

Enhance the privacy of smart contract by EigenCC or EigenFL.

## Specification

### API spec
1. Function signature

   ```solidity
   function eigenCall(uint256 arg1, uint256 arg2, uint256 arg3, uint256 arg4) external pure returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256);
   ```

2. Input

   * `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`, `arg4`: 4 input arguments
   * `arg1` represents the kind of operator. For now, we have implemented:
     - `0`: `EigenTEERegister` operator, register keys in TEE
     - `1`: `add` operator, adds two ciphers, if success, returns the result which is also a cipher
     - `2`: `add1` operator, add a cipher to a number which is a plaintext, if success, returns the result which is also a cipher
     - `3`: `sub` operator, a cipher subs a cipher, if success, returns the result which is also a cipher
     - `4`: `sub1` operator, a cipher subs a number which is a plaintext, if success, returns the result which is also a cipher
     - `11`: `enc` operator, encrypt a number into a cipher, if success, returns the the cipher
     - `12`: `dec` operator, decrypt a cipher into a number, if success, returns the the number
3. Returns

   * `out_arg1`, `out_arg2`, `out_arg3`, `out_arg4`: 4 output arguments
   * `out_arg1` represents if the calling of operator is success:
     - `0`: Success
     - `1`: Fail
   * `out_arg2` represents the result of the operator
   

### Dispute Assertion
The eigenCall is executed off the chain as a kind of secure out-soured computing. While outsourcing, the computing power provider, namely prover, will generate a signature in TEE or a ZKP in Non-TEE, 
as the OneStepProof.
